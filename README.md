***Microsoft Cyber Security Incident Project***

**Overview**

This project involves building a machine learning model to predict outcomes for a cybersecurity incident dataset provided by Microsoft. The goal is to analyze the data, perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), handle missing values, and find patterns that help build an effective predictive model.

**The following steps were performed:**

- EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)
- Handling Missing Values
- Finding Correlations
- Hypothesis Testing (Chi-Square Test)
- Data Visualization (Heatmaps)
- Model Building using Random Forest, KNN, and Decision Tree
- Model Evaluation and Hyperparameter Tuning
- Prediction on Test Data

**Tools & Technologies Used**
- Programming Language: Python
- Libraries:
  - Pandas: For data manipulation and handling missing values.
  - Matplotlib/Seaborn: For data visualization and correlation heatmaps.
  - Scikit-Learn: For machine learning algorithms, cross-validation, and hyperparameter tuning.
